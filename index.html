            <h2>Back-End Web Architecture</h2>
            <p>This article provides an overview of servers, databases, routing, and anything else that happens between
                when a client makes a request and receives a response.
                Software engineers seem to always be discussing the front-end and the back-end of their apps. But what
                exactly does this mean?

                The front-end is the code that is executed on the client side. This code (typically HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript) runs in the user’s browser and creates the user interface.

                The back-end is the code that runs on the server, that receives requests from the clients, and contains
                the logic to send the appropriate data back to the client. The back-end also includes the database,
                which will persistently store all of the data for the application. This article focuses on the hardware
                and software on the server-side that make this possible.

                Review HTTP and REST if you want to refresh your memory on these topics. These are the main conventions
                that provide structure to the request-response cycle between clients and servers.

                Let’s start by reviewing the client-server relationship, and then we can start to put the pieces all
                together!</p>
